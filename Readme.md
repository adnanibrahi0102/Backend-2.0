#  Youtube Like Backend Project

This project is a complex backend project built with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, and many more technologies. This project is a complete backend solution that includes all the features a robust backend should have. I am building a comprehensive video hosting website similar to YouTube with features such as login, signup, video upload, like, dislike, comment, reply, subscribe, unsubscribe, and many more.

The project uses standard practices like JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, access tokens, refresh tokens, and other best practices. I have invested a lot of time in building this project, and I am confident that you will learn a lot from it.
